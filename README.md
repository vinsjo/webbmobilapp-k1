### Styling

I chose to use [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) as a foundation for styling this application mainly because of these reasons:

1. Previously I've mainly used vanilla css, and I wanted to learn something new.
2. I think their components look good by default, without too much customization.
3. They have a very nice [DatePicker](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/) component that suits this project well.
4. Their documentation is great.

### Types

I've chosen to store data in the following formats:

#### Project

```ts
id: number;         // auto generated by json-server
name: string;       // Project name
color: string;      // CSS hex color
```

#### Task

```ts
id: number;         // auto generated by json-server
projectId: number;  // id of parent Project
title: string;      // task title/description
```

#### Timelog

```ts
id: number;         // auto generated by json-server
projectId: number;  // id of parent Project
taskId: number;     // id of parent Task
start: number;      // start time as unix timestamp
end: number;        // end time as a unix timestamp (0 if not ended yet)
```
